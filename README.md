# mb (2003)
A script for presenting a nested list as a menu bar, as commonly done in desktop applications.

This menu has been implemented on this site, try the menus at the top of the page. I have not completed testing and have noticed there are still some bugs, particularly with horizontal menu styles in Netscape6 and Opera7. The vertical menu styles seem OK.
